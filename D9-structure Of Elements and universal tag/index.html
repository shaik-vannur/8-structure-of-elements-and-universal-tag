        Krishna was the key political figure in overthrowing Kamsa, the king of
        Surasena Kingdom. The kingdom of Shurasena was the native kingdom of
        Yadava clans constituted by the Andhakas, Vrishnis, and Bhojas. By
        overthrowing Kamsa, Krishna re-established the old king Ugrasena on the
        throne and stabilized the kingdom from collapse due to factional
        fighting within the kingdom. The next threat came from outside the
        country, from the Magadha Kingdom. The ruler of Magadha, Jarasandha,
        attacked Surasena many times and weakened its military. Krishna and
        other Yadava chiefs all tried their best to hold on. At last, they had
        to flee from their native kingdom to the south and to the west. Later,
        with the initiative of Krishna, the Yadavas who fled from Surasena
        formed a new kingdom called Dvaraka. Its capital was Dvaravati, a city
        well protected by mountains on all sides, on an island, not far from the
        Gujarat coast. This made it immune to attacks from land. The kingdom
        prospered by sea trade with seafaring kingdoms.

        Bhishma (Sanskrit: भीष्म, romanized: bhīṣma, lit. 'mighty'),[1] also
        known as Pitamaha, Gangaputra, and Devavrata, was a prince, statesman
        and commander of ancient Indian Kuru kingdom and is a major character of
        the epic Mahabharata and the protagonist of the Bhishma Parva episode.
        He was the supreme commander of the Kaurava forces during the
        Kurukshetra War. He was the only character who witnessed the entirety of
        the events of the Mahabharata, beginning from the reign of his father,
        King Shantanu of the Kuru kingdom. Bhishma was the stepbrother of Vyasa,
        the grandfather of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He was a
        prominent statesman of the Kuru Kingdom. He was born as the youngest son
        of King Shantanu and goddess Ganga. Originally named Devavrata, he was
        made the heir-apparent of his kingdom. However, he renounced his
        birthright for his father's happiness and took a vow of lifelong
        celibacy. Owing to this selfless decision, he came to be known as
        Bhishma, and was blessed to live as long as he wanted, by his father,
        Shantanu. He participated in the Kurukshetra War on the side of the
        Kauravas. On the tenth day of the war, the Pandava prince Arjuna, with
        the help of Shikhandi, pierced Bhishma with numerous arrows and
        paralysed him upon a bed of arrows. After spending fifty-one nights on
        the arrow bed, the hero Bhishma left his body on the auspicious
        Uttarayana (winter solstice). Before his death, he passed down the
        Vishnu Sahasranama to Yudhishthira.

        As a consequence of Kindama's curse, Pandu became incapable of fathering
        any children. One day, Pandu was regaling the story of his birth and his
        wish of becoming a father to his first wife, Kunti. Kunti told him about
        the child-bearing mantra taught to her by the sage Durvasa. Pandu was
        overjoyed and told Kunti to use it to gain sons from suitable
        deities.[14] He wanted his son to be righteous, and so he suggested
        Dharmaraja, the deity of death and righteousness. Kunti chanted her
        mantra and the deity granted her Yudhishthira. Later, Pandu expressed
        his desire for a powerful son. This time, Kunti invoked Vayu and Bhima
        was born. Pandu suggested Kunti to invoke Indra and a valiant son,
        Arjuna, was born. Pandu felt bad for Madri's childlessness, and thus
        requested Kunti to share her mantra with her. Heeding his request, Kunti
        revealed her mantra once to Pandu's younger wife. Madri invoked the
        Ashvin twins, and then gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva.[15]

        Sutaputra and Radheya,[2] is one of the major characters in the Hindu
        epic Mahābhārata.[3][4] He is the son of Surya (the Sun deity) and
        princess Kunti (later the Pandava queen). Kunti was granted the boon to
        bear a child with desired divine qualities from the gods and without
        much knowledge, Kunti invoked the sun god to confirm it if it was true
        indeed. Karna was secretly born to an unmarried Kunti in her teenage
        years, and fearing outrage and backlash from society over her premarital
        pregnancy, Kunti had to abandon the newly born Karna adrift in a basket
        on the Ganges.[3][5] The basket is discovered floating on the Ganges
        River. He is adopted and raised by foster Suta parents named Radha and
        Adhiratha Nandana[2] of the charioteer and poet profession working for

        Yudhishthira (Sanskrit: युधिष्ठिर, IAST: Yudhiṣṭhira) also known as
        Dharmaraja, was the king of Indraprastha and later the King of Kuru
        Kingdom in the epic Mahabharata. He is the eldest among the five
        Pandavas, and is also one of the central characters of the epic.[2]
        Yudhishthira was the son of Kunti, the first wife of King Pandu,
        fathered by the god Yama due to Pandu's inability to have children.
        Yudhishthira held a belief in dharma (morals and virtues) and was chosen
        to be the crown prince of Kuru. But after the Lakshagriha incident, he
        was presumed to be dead and his cousin Duryodhana was appointed as the
        new heir. The kingdom was split in half due to a succession dispute
        between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana. Yudhishthira received the barren
        half, which he later transformed into the magnificent city of
        Indraprastha.[3] Yudhishthira and his brothers had a polyandrous
        marriage with Draupadi, the princess of Panchala, who became the empress
        of the Indraprastha. After Yudhishthira performed the Rajasuya Yagna, he
        was invited to play a game of dice by his jealous cousin, Duryodhana and
        his uncle, Shakuni. Shakuni, a master at the game, represented
        Duryodhana against Yudhishthira and manipulated him into gambling his
        kingdom, wealth, the freedom of his brothers, Draupadi, and even
        himself. After the game, the Pandavas and Draupadi were sent into exile
        for thirteen years, with the last year requiring them to go incognito.
        During his exile, Yudhisthira was tested by his divine father Yama. For
        the last year of the exile, Yudhishthira disguised himself as Kanka and
        served the King of Matsya Kingdom.[4]

        Bhima (Sanskrit: भीम, IAST: Bhīma), also known as Bhimasena (Sanskrit:
        भीमसेन, IAST: Bhīmasena), is a divine hero and one of the most prominent
        figures in the Indian epic Mahabharata, renowned for his incredible
        strength, fierce loyalty, and key role in the epic’s narrative. As the
        second of the five Pandava brothers, Bhima was born to Kunti—the wife of
        King Pandu—through the blessings of Vayu, the wind god, which bestowed
        upon him superhuman strength from birth. His rivalry with the Kauravas,
        especially Duryodhana, defined much of his life, with this tension
        ultimately erupting in the Kurukshetra War, where Bhima killed all
        hundred Kaurava brothers.[1] Bhima’s life was filled with extraordinary
        episodes that showcased his unmatched strength and bravery. From
        childhood, where he was rescued by the Nagas (divine serpents) after
        being poisoned, to his victories over formidable foes like Bakasura,
        Hidimba, and Jarasandha, Bhima’s adventures are integral to the
        Mahabharata’s storyline. His raw, earthy nature is reflected in the
        brutal slaying of his enemies, his immense appetite and his marriage
        with Hidimbi, a rakshasi (a supernatural being known to consume humans),
        who bore him a son, Ghatotkacha, a powerful warrior who would later play
        a significant role in the Kurukshetra War.[1]

        Arjuna (Sanskrit: अर्जुन, IAST: Arjuna) was an ancient prince of the
        Kuru Kingdom, located in the present-day India. He is one of the main
        protagonists of the Hindu epic Mahābhārata. He was the third of five
        Pandava brothers, from the lineage of the Kuru. In the Mahabharata War,
        Arjuna was a key warrior from the Pandava side in the battle of
        Kurukshetra. Before the beginning of the war, his mentor Krishna gave
        him the supreme knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita to overcome his moral
        dilemmas. In the epic, Arjuna is the closest friend and companion of
        Krishna.[1] Arjuna was the son of Kunti, the wife of Kuru King Pandu,
        and the god Indra, who fathered him due to Pandu's curse. In the
        Mahabharata, Arjuna is depicted as a skilled archer from an early age,
        as a student who earns the favour of his preceptor Drona, as the rival
        of Karna, as the primary adversary of Kauravas, and the betrothed of
        Draupadi, who became the common wife of the Pandavas. Arjuna is twice
        exiled, first for breaking a pact with his brothers, and again with his
        brothers after his eldest brother is tricked into gambling away the
        throne. During his first exile, Arjuna married Ulupi, Chitrāngadā and
        Subhadra. From his four wives, Arjuna had four sons, one from each
        wife—Shrutakarma, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu. During his second
        exile, Arjuna gained many celestial weapons. Apart from being a warrior,
        Arjuna possessed skills in music and dance. At the end of the epic the
        Pandavas, accompanied by Draupadi, retire to the Himalayas, where
        everyone in time passes away to arrive in heaven.

        Sahadeva were the sons of Madri, one of the wives of the Pandava
        patriarch Pandu, and Ashvini Kumaras, the divine twin physicians of the
        gods, whom she invoked to beget her sons due to Pandu's inability to
        progenate. Nakula is described as the most handsome man of his lineage,
        and was renowned for his beauty, skill in swordsmanship and horse
        keeping. He shared the common wife, Draupadi, with his four brothers. He
        was also married to Karenumati of Chedi Kingdom. He had two sons
        Shatanika and Niramitra from his two wives respectively. During the
        Rajasuya of his eldest brother Yudhishthira, he conquered the kings of
        the Sivis, the Rohitakas and other dynasties. After Yudhishthira lost
        all his possessions to his cousin Duryodhana in a dice game, the

        Pandavas' year of incognito exile, he disguised as a horse trainer named
        Granthika, and worked in the kingdom of Virata. Nakula was a skilled
        warrior who fought in the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and their
        cousins Kauravas. After the war, Yudhishthira appointed Nakula as the
        king of northern Madra. At the end of the epic, during the Pandavas'
        journey to the Himalayas to enter heaven, Nakula was the third to fall,
        following Draupadi and Sahadeva, due to his excessive pride in his

        Indian epic, the Mahabharata. He and his twin brother Nakula were the
        sons of Madri, one of the wives of the Pandava patriarch Pandu, and
        Ashvini Kumaras, the divine twin physicians of the gods, whom she
        invoked to beget her sons due to Pandu's inability to progenate. Kunti,
        Sahadeva's step-mother, loved him the most despite his birth to Madri.
        Sahadeva is renowned for his wisdom, knowledge of astrology, and skill
        in swordsmanship. Sahadeva shared the common wife, Draupadi, with his
        four brothers. He was also married to Vijaya of Madra kingdom. He had
        two sons, Shrutasena and Suhotra, from his two wives respectively.
        Sahadeva played a crucial role during the Rajasuya of Yudhishthira,
        where he conquered the kings of the South. After Yudhishthira lost all
        of his possessions to Duryodhana in the game of dice, Sahadeva vowed to

        unfairly win the game. Afterwards, the Pandavas and Draupadi were exiled
        for thirteen years, with the last year being a period of hiding. During
        the hiding, Sahadeva disguised himself as a Vaishya named Tantripala and
        worked as a cowherd in the kingdom of Virata. Sahadeva was a skilled
        warrior who fought in the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and their
        cousins, the Kauravas. On the 18th day of the war, he slayed Shakuni. At

        Dhritarashtra was born blind.[1] He fathered one hundred sons and one

        wife's maid. These children, including the eldest son Duryodhana, but
        not including Yuyutsu and Dushala, came to be known as the Kauravas.A
        historical Kuru King named Dhr̥tarāṣṭra Vaicitravīrya is mentioned in the
        Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā of the Yajurveda (c. 1200–900 BCE) as a descendant of
        the Rigvedic-era King Sudas of the Bharatas. His cattle was reportedly
        destroyed as a result of the conflict with the vrātya ascetics; however,
        this Vedic mention does not provide corroboration for the accuracy of

        Mahabharata. He was the eldest of the Kauravas, the hundred sons of the
        king Dhritarashtra and his queen Gandhari. Being the first-born son of
        the king, he was the crown prince of the Kuru Kingdom and its capital of
        Hastinapura, often forced into ceding the title to his cousin
        Yudhishthira, who was one of the Pandava brothers and older than he.
        Aided by his maternal uncle Shakuni, Duryodhana tricked the Pandavas
        into surrendering their kingdom and forced them to go into exile. Later,
        Duryodhana waged the Kurukshetra War against his cousins and was helped
        by the warriors Bhishma, Drona and Karna. On the eighteenth day of the
        war, he was killed by Bheema. Duryodhana used his greater skill in
        wielding the mace to defeat his opponents. He was also an extremely
        courageous warrior but his greed and arrogance were the two qualities
        said to have led to his downfall.

        When Dhritarashtra's queen Gandhari's pregnancy continued for an
        unusually long time, she beat her womb in frustration and out of
        jealousy towards Kunti, the wife of Pandu, who had just given birth to
        Yudhishthira (the eldest of the five Pandava brothers). At this, a
        hardened mass of grey-coloured flesh emerged from her womb. Gandhari was
        devastated and called upon Vyasa, the great sage who had prophesied she
        would give birth to one hundred sons, to redeem his words.[2] Vyasa
        divided the ball of flesh into one hundred and one equal pieces, each
        piece no bigger than a thumb. He put them in pots of milk, which were
        sealed and buried in the earth for two years. At the end of the second
        year, the first pot was opened and Duryodhana emerged. Within a period
        of one month all the other 99 sons and single daughter of Dhritarashtra
        were born. Dushasana was the second after Duryodhana.[2] Dushasana was
        devoted to his older brother Duryodhana. He (along with Duryodhana and
        Shakuni) was very closely involved in the various schemes and plots to
        kill the Pandavas.

        Yudhisthira lost her freedom in a game of dice to Duryodhana.[2]

        Kunti (Sanskrit: कुन्ती, IAST: Kuntī), born Pritha (Sanskrit: पृथा,
        IAST: Pṛthā), was the queen of Kuru in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Kunti
        was married to Pandu and is the mother of Karna, Yudhishthira, Bhima,
        and Arjuna. She is depicted to possess beauty, intelligence and
        shrewdness. Originally born to the Yadava chief Shurasena, Pritha was
        adopted by her childless uncle, Kuntibhoja, and subsequently bestowed
        with the name Kunti. During her adolescence, she garnered the favour of
        the sage Durvasa, receiving a divine mantra. Intrigued, she employed
        this mantra to invoke the sun god Surya, resulting in the birth of her
        son, Karna. Faced with the societal stigma associated with bearing a
        child out of wedlock, Kunti found herself compelled to relinquish her
        son to safeguard her honour. Upon attaining marriageable age, Kunti
        chose Pandu, the king of Kuru, as her husband. However, her marital
        harmony was disrupted by the inclusion of Madri, the princess of Madra,
        as Pandu's second wife. Pandu, cursed to perish instantly upon
        attempting intimacy with his wives, retired to the forest with Kunti and
        Madri. Responding to her husband's entreaty, Kunti employed her mantra,
        resulting in the birth of Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna. Later, she
        shared this mantra with Madri, who bore Nakula and Sahadeva. Following
        Pandu's demise and Madri's self-immolation, Kunti assumed responsibility
        for her

        Draupadi (Sanskrit: द्रौपदी, romanized: draupadī, lit. 'Daughter of
        Drupada'), also referred to as Krishnā, Panchali, and Yajnaseni, is the
        main female protagonist of the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, and the
        wife of the five Pandava brothers—Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula,
        and Sahadeva.[1] She is noted for her beauty, courage, and polyandrous
        marriage.[2] In the Mahabharata, Draupadi and her twin brother,
        Dhrishtadyumna, were born from a yajna (fire sacrifice) organized by
        King Drupada of Panchala. Arjuna won her hand in marriage, but she had
        to marry the five brothers because of her mother-in-law's
        misunderstanding. Later, she became the empress of Indraprastha after
        Yudhishthira performed the Rajasuya ritual and achieved the status of
        the emperor. She had five sons, one from each Pandava, who were
        collectively addressed as the Upapandavas.[3] The most notable incident
        in Draupadi's life is the game of dice at Hastinapura where Yudhishthira
        lost all his possessions, and she was humiliated by the Kaurava brothers
        and Karna. An attempt was made by Dushasana to disrobe her, but she was
        saved by the divine intervention of Krishna. Following the subsequent
        episodes, Draupadi and the Pandavas were exiled for thirteen years, with
        the last year being a period of hiding when she assumed the identity of
        the maid Sairandhri. The exile was followed by the Kurukshetra War,
        where Draupadi lost her father, brothers, and her five children. After
        the war, she resumed her role as the empress for thirty six years, after
        which she retired to the Himalayas along with her husbands.[4]

        Along with her sisters, Amba and Ambika, Ambalika was taken by force by
        Bhishma during their svayamvara, the latter having challenged and
        defeated the assembled royalty. He presented them to Satyavati for
        marriage to Vichitravirya.[3] Ambalika and her sister spent seven years
        in their husband's company. Vichitravirya was afflicted with
        tuberculosis, and died from the disease.[4][5] After Vichitravirya's
        death, since he left no heirs, his mother Satyavati sent for her first
        born, the sage Vyasa. She asked him to father children with the widowed
        queens of Vichitravirya, according to the prevalent custom of niyoga.
        Vyasa had come from years of intense meditation and as a result, he
        looked tremendously unkempt. When he approached Ambika, she closed her
        eyes in fear. As a result, the blind Dhritrashtra was born. When he
        approached Ambalika, she turned pale in fear. Her son Pandu, as the
        result of the niyoga, was born with a pale appearance.[6][7] Her son
        Pandu was married to Kunti and Madri. She is the grandmother of Pandavas
        – Yudhishtira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, who were the central
        characters of the epic.[8][9] After the death of Pandu, Ambalika
        accompanied her mother-in-law Satyavati, and sister Ambika, to the
        forest, and spent the rest of her days in spiritual retreat.[10]

        Gandhari was born to Subala and Sudharmaa of Gandhara. Gandhari is
        regarded as an incarnation of the goddess Mati.[2] She was the sister of
        Shakuni.[citation needed] As a maiden, she is said to have impressed
        Shiva through penance and received a boon to bear a hundred children.
        However, the reason for her penance and her receiving such boon is
        unknown. In alternate versions, she is said to have impressed Veda Vyasa
        with her gracious and generous nature. One of the main reasons of
        Bhishma choosing Gandhari to be the elder daughter-in-law of the Kuru
        Kingdom is said to be this boon, which would put an end to his worry of
        the throne remaining vacant.[citation needed] Gandhari's marriage was
        arranged with Dhritarashtra, the eldest prince of the Kuru kingdom. The
        Mahabharata depicted her as a devout woman, beautiful and virtuous.
        Their marriage was arranged by Bhishma. When she found out that her
        would-be husband was born blind, she decided to blindfold herself in
        order to emulate her husband's experiences. It is stated that the act of
        blindfolding herself was a sign of dedication and love. The Mahabharata
        depicts her marriage as a major reason for the story's central conflict,
        since her brother Shakuni was furious to learn that her husband was
        blind. However in Vyasa's Mahabharata, there is no mention of Shakuni
        objecting to Gandhari's marriage with Dhritarashtra. As per the Adi
        Parva of the Mahabharata, Shakuni brought Gandhari to Hastinapura for
        marriage. Gandhari was welcomed by the Kuru elders and Shakuni gave many
        gifts to Hastinapura and returned to his kingdom
