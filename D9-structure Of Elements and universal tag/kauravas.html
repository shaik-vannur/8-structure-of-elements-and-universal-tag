        Duryodhana (Sanskrit: दुर्योधन, IAST: Duryodhana), also known as
        Suyodhana,[1][2] is the primary antagonist in the Hindu epic
        Mahabharata. He was the eldest of the Kauravas, the hundred sons of the
        king Dhritarashtra and his queen Gandhari. Being the first-born son of
        the king, he was the crown prince of the Kuru Kingdom and its capital of
        Hastinapura, often forced into ceding the title to his cousin
        Yudhishthira, who was one of the Pandava brothers and older than he.
        Aided by his maternal uncle Shakuni, Duryodhana tricked the Pandavas
        into surrendering their kingdom and forced them to go into exile. Later,
        Duryodhana waged the Kurukshetra War against his cousins and was helped
        by the warriors Bhishma, Drona and Karna. On the eighteenth day of the
        war, he was killed by Bheema. Duryodhana used his greater skill in
        wielding the mace to defeat his opponents. He was also an extremely
        courageous warrior but his greed and arrogance were the two qualities
        said to have led to his downfall.

        When Dhritarashtra's queen Gandhari's pregnancy continued for an
        unusually long time, she beat her womb in frustration and out of
        jealousy towards Kunti, the wife of Pandu, who had just given birth to
        Yudhishthira (the eldest of the five Pandava brothers). At this, a
        hardened mass of grey-coloured flesh emerged from her womb. Gandhari was
        devastated and called upon Vyasa, the great sage who had prophesied she
        would give birth to one hundred sons, to redeem his words.[2] Vyasa
        divided the ball of flesh into one hundred and one equal pieces, each
        piece no bigger than a thumb. He put them in pots of milk, which were
        sealed and buried in the earth for two years. At the end of the second
        year, the first pot was opened and Duryodhana emerged. Within a period
        of one month all the other 99 sons and single daughter of Dhritarashtra
        were born. Dushasana was the second after Duryodhana.[2] Dushasana was
        devoted to his older brother Duryodhana. He (along with Duryodhana and
        Shakuni) was very closely involved in the various schemes and plots to
        kill the Pandavas.

        In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Vikarna (Sanskrit: विकर्ण) was the third
        Kaurava, a son of Dhritarashtra and Gandhari, and a brother to the crown
        prince Duryodhana. Vikarna is also referred to as the most reputable of
        the Kauravas.[1] Vikarna was the only Kaurava who opposed the
        humiliation of Draupadi, the wife of his cousins of the Pandavas after
        Yudhisthira lost her freedom in a game of dice to Duryodhana.[2]
