        Bhishma (Sanskrit: भीष्म, romanized: bhīṣma, lit. 'mighty'),[1] also
        known as Pitamaha, Gangaputra, and Devavrata, was a prince, statesman
        and commander of ancient Indian Kuru kingdom and is a major character of
        the epic Mahabharata and the protagonist of the Bhishma Parva episode.
        He was the supreme commander of the Kaurava forces during the
        Kurukshetra War. He was the only character who witnessed the entirety of
        the events of the Mahabharata, beginning from the reign of his father,
        King Shantanu of the Kuru kingdom. Bhishma was the stepbrother of Vyasa,
        the grandfather of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He was a
        prominent statesman of the Kuru Kingdom. He was born as the youngest son
        of King Shantanu and goddess Ganga. Originally named Devavrata, he was
        made the heir-apparent of his kingdom. However, he renounced his
        birthright for his father's happiness and took a vow of lifelong
        celibacy. Owing to this selfless decision, he came to be known as
        Bhishma, and was blessed to live as long as he wanted, by his father,
        Shantanu. He participated in the Kurukshetra War on the side of the
        Kauravas. On the tenth day of the war, the Pandava prince Arjuna, with
        the help of Shikhandi, pierced Bhishma with numerous arrows and
        paralysed him upon a bed of arrows. After spending fifty-one nights on
        the arrow bed, the hero Bhishma left his body on the auspicious
        Uttarayana (winter solstice). Before his death, he passed down the
        Vishnu Sahasranama to Yudhishthira.

        Karna (Sanskrit: कर्ण, IAST: Karṇa), also known as Vasusena, Anga-Raja,
        Sutaputra and Radheya,[2] is one of the major characters in the Hindu
        epic Mahābhārata.[3][4] He is the son of Surya (the Sun deity) and
        princess Kunti (later the Pandava queen). Kunti was granted the boon to
        bear a child with desired divine qualities from the gods and without
        much knowledge, Kunti invoked the sun god to confirm it if it was true
        indeed. Karna was secretly born to an unmarried Kunti in her teenage
        years, and fearing outrage and backlash from society over her premarital
        pregnancy, Kunti had to abandon the newly born Karna adrift in a basket
        on the Ganges.[3][5] The basket is discovered floating on the Ganges
        River. He is adopted and raised by foster Suta parents named Radha and
        Adhiratha Nandana[2] of the charioteer and poet profession working for
        king Dhritarashtra.[3] Karna grows up to be an accomplished warrior of
        extraordinary abilities, a gifted speaker and becomes a loyal friend of
        Duryodhana.[3][6] He is appointed the king of Anga (Bihar-Bengal)[7] by
        Duryodhana.[2] Karna joins the losing Duryodhana side of the Mahabharata
        war. He is a key antagonist who aims to kill Arjuna but dies in a battle
        with him during the Kurushetra war.[3][4
