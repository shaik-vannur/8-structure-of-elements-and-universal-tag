        Kunti (Sanskrit: कुन्ती, IAST: Kuntī), born Pritha (Sanskrit: पृथा,
        IAST: Pṛthā), was the queen of Kuru in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. Kunti
        was married to Pandu and is the mother of Karna, Yudhishthira, Bhima,
        and Arjuna. She is depicted to possess beauty, intelligence and
        shrewdness. Originally born to the Yadava chief Shurasena, Pritha was
        adopted by her childless uncle, Kuntibhoja, and subsequently bestowed
        with the name Kunti. During her adolescence, she garnered the favour of
        the sage Durvasa, receiving a divine mantra. Intrigued, she employed
        this mantra to invoke the sun god Surya, resulting in the birth of her
        son, Karna. Faced with the societal stigma associated with bearing a
        child out of wedlock, Kunti found herself compelled to relinquish her
        son to safeguard her honour. Upon attaining marriageable age, Kunti
        chose Pandu, the king of Kuru, as her husband. However, her marital
        harmony was disrupted by the inclusion of Madri, the princess of Madra,
        as Pandu's second wife. Pandu, cursed to perish instantly upon
        attempting intimacy with his wives, retired to the forest with Kunti and
        Madri. Responding to her husband's entreaty, Kunti employed her mantra,
        resulting in the birth of Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna. Later, she
        shared this mantra with Madri, who bore Nakula and Sahadeva. Following
        Pandu's demise and Madri's self-immolation, Kunti assumed responsibility
        for her

        Draupadi (Sanskrit: द्रौपदी, romanized: draupadī, lit. 'Daughter of
        Drupada'), also referred to as Krishnā, Panchali, and Yajnaseni, is the
        main female protagonist of the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, and the
        wife of the five Pandava brothers—Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula,
        and Sahadeva.[1] She is noted for her beauty, courage, and polyandrous
        marriage.[2] In the Mahabharata, Draupadi and her twin brother,
        Dhrishtadyumna, were born from a yajna (fire sacrifice) organized by
        King Drupada of Panchala. Arjuna won her hand in marriage, but she had
        to marry the five brothers because of her mother-in-law's
        misunderstanding. Later, she became the empress of Indraprastha after
        Yudhishthira performed the Rajasuya ritual and achieved the status of
        the emperor. She had five sons, one from each Pandava, who were
        collectively addressed as the Upapandavas.[3] The most notable incident
        in Draupadi's life is the game of dice at Hastinapura where Yudhishthira
        lost all his possessions, and she was humiliated by the Kaurava brothers
        and Karna. An attempt was made by Dushasana to disrobe her, but she was
        saved by the divine intervention of Krishna. Following the subsequent
        episodes, Draupadi and the Pandavas were exiled for thirteen years, with
        the last year being a period of hiding when she assumed the identity of
        the maid Sairandhri. The exile was followed by the Kurukshetra War,
        where Draupadi lost her father, brothers, and her five children. After
        the war, she resumed her role as the empress for thirty six years, after
        which she retired to the Himalayas along with her husbands.[4]

        Along with her sisters, Amba and Ambika, Ambalika was taken by force by
        Bhishma during their svayamvara, the latter having challenged and
        defeated the assembled royalty. He presented them to Satyavati for
        marriage to Vichitravirya.[3] Ambalika and her sister spent seven years
        in their husband's company. Vichitravirya was afflicted with
        tuberculosis, and died from the disease.[4][5] After Vichitravirya's
        death, since he left no heirs, his mother Satyavati sent for her first
        born, the sage Vyasa. She asked him to father children with the widowed
        queens of Vichitravirya, according to the prevalent custom of niyoga.
        Vyasa had come from years of intense meditation and as a result, he
        looked tremendously unkempt. When he approached Ambika, she closed her
        eyes in fear. As a result, the blind Dhritrashtra was born. When he
        approached Ambalika, she turned pale in fear. Her son Pandu, as the
        result of the niyoga, was born with a pale appearance.[6][7] Her son
        Pandu was married to Kunti and Madri. She is the grandmother of Pandavas
        – Yudhishtira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, who were the central
        characters of the epic.[8][9] After the death of Pandu, Ambalika
        accompanied her mother-in-law Satyavati, and sister Ambika, to the
        forest, and spent the rest of her days in spiritual retreat.[10]

        Gandhari was born to Subala and Sudharmaa of Gandhara. Gandhari is
        regarded as an incarnation of the goddess Mati.[2] She was the sister of
        Shakuni.[citation needed] As a maiden, she is said to have impressed
        Shiva through penance and received a boon to bear a hundred children.
        However, the reason for her penance and her receiving such boon is
        unknown. In alternate versions, she is said to have impressed Veda Vyasa
        with her gracious and generous nature. One of the main reasons of
        Bhishma choosing Gandhari to be the elder daughter-in-law of the Kuru
        Kingdom is said to be this boon, which would put an end to his worry of
        the throne remaining vacant.[citation needed] Gandhari's marriage was
        arranged with Dhritarashtra, the eldest prince of the Kuru kingdom. The
        Mahabharata depicted her as a devout woman, beautiful and virtuous.
        Their marriage was arranged by Bhishma. When she found out that her
        would-be husband was born blind, she decided to blindfold herself in
        order to emulate her husband's experiences. It is stated that the act of
        blindfolding herself was a sign of dedication and love. The Mahabharata
        depicts her marriage as a major reason for the story's central conflict,
        since her brother Shakuni was furious to learn that her husband was
        blind. However in Vyasa's Mahabharata, there is no mention of Shakuni
        objecting to Gandhari's marriage with Dhritarashtra. As per the Adi
        Parva of the Mahabharata, Shakuni brought Gandhari to Hastinapura for
        marriage. Gandhari was welcomed by the Kuru elders and Shakuni gave many
        gifts to Hastinapura and returned to his kingdom
