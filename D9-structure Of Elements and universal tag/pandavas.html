        As a consequence of Kindama's curse, Pandu became incapable of fathering
        any children. One day, Pandu was regaling the story of his birth and his
        wish of becoming a father to his first wife, Kunti. Kunti told him about
        the child-bearing mantra taught to her by the sage Durvasa. Pandu was
        overjoyed and told Kunti to use it to gain sons from suitable
        deities.[14] He wanted his son to be righteous, and so he suggested
        Dharmaraja, the deity of death and righteousness. Kunti chanted her
        mantra and the deity granted her Yudhishthira. Later, Pandu expressed
        his desire for a powerful son. This time, Kunti invoked Vayu and Bhima
        was born. Pandu suggested Kunti to invoke Indra and a valiant son,
        Arjuna, was born. Pandu felt bad for Madri's childlessness, and thus
        requested Kunti to share her mantra with her. Heeding his request, Kunti
        revealed her mantra once to Pandu's younger wife. Madri invoked the
        Ashvin twins, and then gave birth to Nakula and Sahadeva.[15]

        Yudhishthira (Sanskrit: युधिष्ठिर, IAST: Yudhiṣṭhira) also known as
        Dharmaraja, was the king of Indraprastha and later the King of Kuru
        Kingdom in the epic Mahabharata. He is the eldest among the five
        Pandavas, and is also one of the central characters of the epic.[2]
        Yudhishthira was the son of Kunti, the first wife of King Pandu,
        fathered by the god Yama due to Pandu's inability to have children.
        Yudhishthira held a belief in dharma (morals and virtues) and was chosen
        to be the crown prince of Kuru. But after the Lakshagriha incident, he
        was presumed to be dead and his cousin Duryodhana was appointed as the
        new heir. The kingdom was split in half due to a succession dispute
        between Yudhishthira and Duryodhana. Yudhishthira received the barren
        half, which he later transformed into the magnificent city of
        Indraprastha.[3] Yudhishthira and his brothers had a polyandrous
        marriage with Draupadi, the princess of Panchala, who became the empress
        of the Indraprastha. After Yudhishthira performed the Rajasuya Yagna, he
        was invited to play a game of dice by his jealous cousin, Duryodhana and
        his uncle, Shakuni. Shakuni, a master at the game, represented
        Duryodhana against Yudhishthira and manipulated him into gambling his
        kingdom, wealth, the freedom of his brothers, Draupadi, and even
        himself. After the game, the Pandavas and Draupadi were sent into exile
        for thirteen years, with the last year requiring them to go incognito.
        During his exile, Yudhisthira was tested by his divine father Yama. For
        the last year of the exile, Yudhishthira disguised himself as Kanka and
        served the King of Matsya Kingdom.[4]

        Bhima (Sanskrit: भीम, IAST: Bhīma), also known as Bhimasena (Sanskrit:
        भीमसेन, IAST: Bhīmasena), is a divine hero and one of the most prominent
        figures in the Indian epic Mahabharata, renowned for his incredible
        strength, fierce loyalty, and key role in the epic’s narrative. As the
        second of the five Pandava brothers, Bhima was born to Kunti—the wife of
        King Pandu—through the blessings of Vayu, the wind god, which bestowed
        upon him superhuman strength from birth. His rivalry with the Kauravas,
        especially Duryodhana, defined much of his life, with this tension
        ultimately erupting in the Kurukshetra War, where Bhima killed all
        hundred Kaurava brothers.[1] Bhima’s life was filled with extraordinary
        episodes that showcased his unmatched strength and bravery. From
        childhood, where he was rescued by the Nagas (divine serpents) after
        being poisoned, to his victories over formidable foes like Bakasura,
        Hidimba, and Jarasandha, Bhima’s adventures are integral to the
        Mahabharata’s storyline. His raw, earthy nature is reflected in the
        brutal slaying of his enemies, his immense appetite and his marriage
        with Hidimbi, a rakshasi (a supernatural being known to consume humans),
        who bore him a son, Ghatotkacha, a powerful warrior who would later play
        a significant role in the Kurukshetra War.[1]

        Arjuna (Sanskrit: अर्जुन, IAST: Arjuna) was an ancient prince of the
        Kuru Kingdom, located in the present-day India. He is one of the main
        protagonists of the Hindu epic Mahābhārata. He was the third of five
        Pandava brothers, from the lineage of the Kuru. In the Mahabharata War,
        Arjuna was a key warrior from the Pandava side in the battle of
        Kurukshetra. Before the beginning of the war, his mentor Krishna gave
        him the supreme knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita to overcome his moral
        dilemmas. In the epic, Arjuna is the closest friend and companion of
        Krishna.[1] Arjuna was the son of Kunti, the wife of Kuru King Pandu,
        and the god Indra, who fathered him due to Pandu's curse. In the
        Mahabharata, Arjuna is depicted as a skilled archer from an early age,
        as a student who earns the favour of his preceptor Drona, as the rival
        of Karna, as the primary adversary of Kauravas, and the betrothed of
        Draupadi, who became the common wife of the Pandavas. Arjuna is twice
        exiled, first for breaking a pact with his brothers, and again with his
        brothers after his eldest brother is tricked into gambling away the
        throne. During his first exile, Arjuna married Ulupi, Chitrāngadā and
        Subhadra. From his four wives, Arjuna had four sons, one from each
        wife—Shrutakarma, Iravan, Babhruvahana and Abhimanyu. During his second
        exile, Arjuna gained many celestial weapons. Apart from being a warrior,
        Arjuna possessed skills in music and dance. At the end of the epic the
        Pandavas, accompanied by Draupadi, retire to the Himalayas, where
        everyone in time passes away to arrive in heaven.

        Nakula (Sanskrit: नकुल) was the fourth of the five Pandava brothers in
        the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata. He and his twin brother
        Sahadeva were the sons of Madri, one of the wives of the Pandava
        patriarch Pandu, and Ashvini Kumaras, the divine twin physicians of the
        gods, whom she invoked to beget her sons due to Pandu's inability to
        progenate. Nakula is described as the most handsome man of his lineage,
        and was renowned for his beauty, skill in swordsmanship and horse
        keeping. He shared the common wife, Draupadi, with his four brothers. He
        was also married to Karenumati of Chedi Kingdom. He had two sons
        Shatanika and Niramitra from his two wives respectively. During the
        Rajasuya of his eldest brother Yudhishthira, he conquered the kings of
        the Sivis, the Rohitakas and other dynasties. After Yudhishthira lost
        all his possessions to his cousin Duryodhana in a dice game, the
        Pandavas and Draupadi were exiled for thirteen years. During the
        Pandavas' year of incognito exile, he disguised as a horse trainer named
        Granthika, and worked in the kingdom of Virata. Nakula was a skilled
        warrior who fought in the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and their
        cousins Kauravas. After the war, Yudhishthira appointed Nakula as the
        king of northern Madra. At the end of the epic, during the Pandavas'
        journey to the Himalayas to enter heaven, Nakula was the third to fall,
        following Draupadi and Sahadeva, due to his excessive pride in his
        beauty.

        Sahadeva (Sanskrit: सहदेव, romanized: Sahadeva, lit. 'one with the
        gods') was the youngest of the five Pandava brothers in the ancient
        Indian epic, the Mahabharata. He and his twin brother Nakula were the
        sons of Madri, one of the wives of the Pandava patriarch Pandu, and
        Ashvini Kumaras, the divine twin physicians of the gods, whom she
        invoked to beget her sons due to Pandu's inability to progenate. Kunti,
        Sahadeva's step-mother, loved him the most despite his birth to Madri.
        Sahadeva is renowned for his wisdom, knowledge of astrology, and skill
        in swordsmanship. Sahadeva shared the common wife, Draupadi, with his
        four brothers. He was also married to Vijaya of Madra kingdom. He had
        two sons, Shrutasena and Suhotra, from his two wives respectively.
        Sahadeva played a crucial role during the Rajasuya of Yudhishthira,
        where he conquered the kings of the South. After Yudhishthira lost all
        of his possessions to Duryodhana in the game of dice, Sahadeva vowed to
        slay Shakuni, Duryodhana's maternal uncle, who had used loaded dice to
        unfairly win the game. Afterwards, the Pandavas and Draupadi were exiled
        for thirteen years, with the last year being a period of hiding. During
        the hiding, Sahadeva disguised himself as a Vaishya named Tantripala and
        worked as a cowherd in the kingdom of Virata. Sahadeva was a skilled
        warrior who fought in the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and their
        cousins, the Kauravas. On the 18th day of the war, he slayed Shakuni. At
        the end of the epic, during the Pandavas' journey in the Himalayas to
        enter svarga (heaven), Sahadeva was the second to fall, following
        Draupadi, due to his excessive pride in his wisdom.
